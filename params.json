{"name":"Jquery-loadbar","tagline":"A modern jquery accelerated html5 multipurpose loadingbar.","body":"Intro\r\n=====\r\n\r\njQuery Loadbar is a tool for manipulating and controlling loadingbars / progressbars (short. \"loadbar\").\r\nThe plugin itself is very lightweight; the minified (non-gzipped) version weighs merely 0.5kb, which means that the script will hardly affect any load times.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n===\r\n\r\nThe script has only one function: \"loadbar();\". The function is fairly simple; you choose whether to increment the\r\nloadingbar by any amount between 1-100 or to assign an exact value to it. Lastly, you can configure the bar fillrate \r\nby defining how fast the flowing color will animate by passing a string (\"slow\", \"medium\" or \"fast\") as an argument to the function\r\n\r\nThe function syntax is as follows: $(\".anyClass, #id or element\").loadbar(value, filling, speed);\r\nValue is an integer while filling and speed are both strings.\r\n\r\nSample usage:\r\n\r\n    $(\".loadbar\").loadbar(35,\"increment\");\r\n    $(\".loadbar\").loadbar(15,\"increment\");\r\n    $(\".loadbar\").loadbar(55);\r\n    $(\".loadbar2\").loadbar(0); //the loadbars are independent and work separately.\r\n    $(\"button\").click(function(){\r\n        $(\".loadbar2\").loadbar(10,\"increment\");\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  \r\n     \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
